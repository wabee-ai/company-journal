# How everything started

For the past 13 months weâ€™ve been working on agentic AI integration with generative models.

Our team was working on the MLOps problem for a while, and after merging our previous startup with a larger enterprise data company, we started working with some other amazing people who were passionated about applying machine learning to solve real problems for organizations. I founded Elemeno with the mission of democratizing access to Machine Learning, and our approach was to make the process of building and serving models so easy that any person with minimum experience in the field could do it. 

The companies we worked with would either not have the basic resources for doing it, or their ML people would be swamped on endless projects.
Around April 23 we have already built our own serving infra for large pre-trained models, and we were experimenting with an autonomous module that would leverage LLMs and tool calling capabilities to automate feature engineering and help users go from idea + raw unprepared dataset to a ML-ready feature store. 

It was during an internal hackathon where the winning team made a financial assistant that our focus started shifting more towards agentic AI. By combining a naive RAG with a human-like conversational experience, in one day we built this software prototype that was able to monitor earning reports from a set of public listed companies and provide similar level of insights that you would only get from very specialized and hardly accessible wealth management and research firms.

From that day I realized that we were focusing on the wrong layer of this whole chain, I finally convinced myself that soon only few highly specialized teams would need to work on the model layer, and that the path for democratizing access to the benefits of this technology would be in the application layer.

We then started building Wabee, which was codenamed AI Agents first. Our approach is still to remove complexities and bringing convinience, and we keep getting amazed with how easy it is becoming to build advanced systems with intelligence to solve real world problems.

**Wabee detached from the larger data company in July 24**, and we are fully independent since then.

I will keep posting a journal of our relevant findings and important milestones in this journal as a way of documenting the journey of a group that started working early on the most transformative technology that humans have created to date.
